📊 Telecom Churn Prediction
🚀 Overview
Telecom Churn Prediction is a machine learning-based project that identifies customers likely to discontinue telecom services. Customer churn significantly affects revenue and long-term growth. This project analyzes customer behavior, usage patterns, and demographics to build predictive models that help telecom operators reduce churn through proactive retention strategies.

🎯 Objective
To develop a predictive model that accurately classifies customers as churners or non-churners using historical telecom data, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.

⚙️ Key Features
Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering for clean and balanced datasets.
Implementation and comparison of multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Achieved highest accuracy of 81.20% using the Random Forest Classifier.
Visualization of churn patterns and correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Actionable insights to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

🧠 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow
Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy (%)
Logistic Regression	78.4
Random Forest	81.2
SVM	79.6
Naïve Bayes	76.8
ANN	80.1

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier – High accuracy and balanced performance across metrics.

🔍 Data Insights

Customers with short tenure and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

High monthly charges strongly correlate with churn probability.

Automatic payment methods show better retention rates.

🧾 Outcome
The developed model enables telecom providers to predict potential churners early, allowing targeted offers and improved customer satisfaction. It demonstrates how data-driven machine learning approaches can reduce churn and enhance business sustainability.

📚 Future Enhancements
Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Integrate real-time churn monitoring dashboards.
Explore deep learning (LSTM, CNN) for higher accuracy.
Automate retraining for continuous improvement.
